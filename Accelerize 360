Chill interview only HR; No technical.
He asked me 5 BEST practices a coder can have.
The 5 things that the Gym application can have.
He told that I sound more like a functional guy rather than a technical guy.
This might be a compliment or could even take away my chances of getting an offer letter.
Let's wait for the result. Fingers Crossed.
