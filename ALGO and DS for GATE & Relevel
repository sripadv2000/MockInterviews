Heap: Heap is a complete/ almost complete binary tree.

There are two types of a heap on the basis of the property.

Max-heap: The key present at any node must be greater than the keys present at both of its children.
The largest key is at the root node.

Mix-heap: The key present at any node must be smaller than the keys present at both of its children.
The smallest key is at the root node.

Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented as an array.
