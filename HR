Tell me about yourself.
My name is Sripad Vayuvegula. I am a tech-savvy engineeering graduate specialized Computer Science. I have a CGPA of 8.34. I am interested in Competitive Coding and 
Building websites. I am currently a Research IoT intern at IIIT Hyderabad and by the end of the internship, I have built a Gas sensor which detects any leakage and 
notifies the owner by sending email and a message. Last year, I have interned at Brain o vision Solutions where I developed many front end websites. My hobbies are 
reading books, working out/exercising and playing chess.


Strengths and weaknesses
I think one of my greatest strengths is that I am a great team player. I am also a
self-motivated and quick learning individual. Whatever task that I set to do, I
always give my best and complete it diligently well in advance. My weakness
would be that I am learning to master people skills while meeting new
individuals. I get nervous while talking to new people. I have been working on
this for quite a long time and I can say with utmost confidence that I have come a
long way.

I learned that effective and graceful communication is the ultimate key. 
Ideas should be respectfully conveyed to people when there are disagreements as we belong to a
team and the collective vision of the team is to launch the project successfully. In
case my managerâ€™s idea was best for the project, then I would gracefully accept
that too.
