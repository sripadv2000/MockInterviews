ML is a subset of AI. It focuses mainly on the designing of systems, thereby allowing them to learn and make predictions based on some experience which is data in case of machines.
ML helps the computer to act and take data driven decisions rather than explicitly programmed to carry out a certain task.
These programs are designed to learn and improve when subjected to new data.

AI is a technique which enables machines to mimic human behaviour.
ML is a subset of AI technique which use statistical methods to enable machines to improve with experience.
Deep Learning DL is a subset of ML which make the computation of multi-layer neural network feasible.

ML Types:
-Supervised
-Unsupervised
-Reinforcement

-Supervised learning if where I have input variables X and output variable Y, and I use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.
- y= f(x)
Supervised Learning Algorithms
-Linear Regression
-Random Forest
-Support Vector Machines

Supervised Examples and Use Cases:
-Cortana
-Weather app
-Biometric Attendance
-Supervised learning in Banking
-Supervised learning in Healthcare
-Supervised learning in Retail

-Unsupervised learning if where I have input variable X and no corresponding output variable.
- The goal pf unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data inorder to learn more about the data.

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
-Apriori Algorithm 
-Random Forest
-Support Vector Machines
