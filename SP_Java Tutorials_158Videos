Data Types in Java

Data Types are of 2 types: Primitive and Non-Primitive.
Primitive is of 2 types: Boolean(boolean) and Numeric.
Numeric is of 2 types: Character(char) and Integral
Integral is of 2 types: Integer(byte,short,int,long) and Floating Point(float,double)

Non-Primitive Data Types(String,Array,Class,Structure,Union,etc.)

The size of boolean is 1bit, but is precisely defined by the JVM.
char-2byte
byte-8bit
short-2byte
int-4byte
long-8byte
float-4byte
double-8byte

Defining a Data Type:
int a=10;
char c='x';
boolean b=True;

The size of all the Primitive Data Types is fixed whereas that of Non-Primitive Data Types is not fixed.
