#1 Data Types in Java

Data Types are of 2 types: Primitive and Non-Primitive.
Primitive is of 2 types: Boolean(boolean) and Numeric.
Numeric is of 2 types: Character(char) and Integral
Integral is of 2 types: Integer(byte,short,int,long) and Floating Point(float,double)

Non-Primitive Data Types(String,Array,Class,Structure,Union,etc.)

The size of boolean is 1bit, but is precisely defined by the JVM.
char-2byte
byte-8bit
short-2byte
int-4byte
long-8byte
float-4byte
double-8byte

Defining a Data Type:
int a=10;
char c='x';
boolean b=True;

The size of all the Primitive Data Types is fixed whereas that of Non-Primitive Data Types is not fixed.

#2 Variables in Java

A java variable is a piece of memory that can contain a data value. A variable thus has a data type.
Variables are typically used to store information which your Java program needs to do its job.
There are 3 types of variables:
1. Local
2. Instance
3. Static

class A
{
  int a=10; //instance variable
  static int b=20; //static variable
  void add()
  {
    int c=30,d; //local variables
    d=a+b+c;
    S.o.p(d);
  }
  void mul()
  {
    int e=40,f;//local variables
    f=a*b*e;
    S.o.p(e);
  }
}

Local Variables
1. DECLARATION: inside methods,constructor or block.
2. SCOPE: inside method,constructor or block not outside.
3. WHEN VARIABLES GETS ALLOCATED IN MEMORY: when method,constructor or blockgets executed,variables are allocated memory, when it exits, variables are destroyed.
4. STORED MEMORY: Stack Memory
5. DEFAULT VALUES: Doesn't have any default values. Value should be provided before use.
6. ACCESS SPECIFIERS: Cannot be used with local variables.
