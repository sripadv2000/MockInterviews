1. Choose a text editor
2. Creating a HTML file
HTML is a language that is used to define layouts for web pages and we can define those layouts using things called tags.
Using things called tags, I can create a series of tags and those tags will tell my web browser how I wanted my website to look and what content I want in my website.

Start with the <!DOCTYPE html>
This tag tells my browser that this is a HTML document.
This is a single tag.

Now we have to create container tags.
Like <html> ...... </html>
These tags act like containers for other tags and information.
<html> is the highest level tag or overall container tag.

Now there two other sets of tags that I need to create.
The head tags and the body tags.
In any HTML file, there is basically 2 sections.
There is a head section and a body section.
<head> .... </head>
The head defines the data about the document so we can define things like the title of the document we can give the description.
We can also use the head to import any resources that we need into our HTML file.
I can also link this HTML file to other types of files. 

<head>
The body tag is where we are gonna put the meat and bones of the HTML page.
It is where the whole HTML content is gonna go. The body tag is gonna be a lot bigger than the head tag.

The web browser is able to look through all of these tags and figure out information about the page.

3. Basic Tags
<meta charset="UTF-8"> - We use this to define the character encoding for my webpage.  This tells the web browser what types of characters I'm using inside this document.
<meta name="description" content="This is an awesome website">- To provide description for our website and this tag can be used by things like web browsers.
