What is a Database?
-Any collection of related information.
--Ex: Phone Book, Shopping List, Todo List, Facebook's User Base

-Databases can be stored in different ways.
--Ex: On paper, In your mind, On a computer, Powerpoint, Comments Section.

Computers + Databases = <3

Amazon.com vs Shopping List

1. Amazon.com keeps track of Products, Reviews, Purchase Orders, Credit Cards, Users, Media, etc. whereas the Shopping list keeps track of consuer products that need to be purchased.
2. Amazon.com has trillions of pieces of information need to be stored ad readily available whereas in the Shopping List, 10-20 pieces of information need to be stored and readily available.
3. Information is extremely valuable and critical to Amazon.com's functioning whereas in the Shopping ist, the information if for convenience sake only and not necessary for shopping.
4. Security is essential, Amazon stores people's personal information like Credit Card, SSN, Address, Phone Number whereas security is not important for the Shopping List.
5. Information is stored on the computer whereas in the Shopping List, Information is hust stored on a piece of paper, or even just in memory.

Computers are great at keeping track of large amounts of data.

DBMS is a special software program that helps users create and maintain a database.
- Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information.
- Handles security.
- Backups.
- Importing/Exporting data.
- Concurrency
- Interacts with software applications.
-- Programming Languages.

CRUD  

There are 2 types of Databases

Relational database(SQL)
- Organise data into one or more tables.
--Each table has columns and rows
-- A unique key identifies each row.

Non-Relational(noSQL/ not just SQL)
-Organise data is anything but a traditional table.
-- Key-value stores
-- Documents(JSON, XML, etc)
-- Graphs
-- Flexible Tables

Relational Databases(SQL)
-Relational DBMS
--Helps users create and maintan a relational database.
--- Ex: mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB, etc.

- SQL
- Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS.
- Used to perform C.R.U.D operations, as well as other administrative tasks(user management, security, backup, etc.)
- Used to define tables and structures.
- SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification.

Non-Relational Databases
- Document(JSON, BLOB, XML, etc.)
- Graph(Relational Nodes)
- Key-Value Hash(Keys are mapped to values(strings, json, blob, etc.))

Non-Relational(noSQL/ not just SQL)
- Help users create and maintain a non-relational database.
-- mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase, etc.

-Implementation specific
-- Any non-relational database falls under this category, so there's no set language standard.
-- Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing CRUD and administrative operations on the database.

database Queries
- Queries are requests made to the DBMS for specific information.
- As the database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific pieces of information we want.
- A google search is a query.

WRAP UP
- Database is any collection of related information.
- Computer are great for storing databases.
- DBMS make it easy to create, maintain and secure a database.
- DBMS allows you to perform CRUD operations and other administrative tasks.
- Two types of Databases, Relational and Non-Relational.
- Relational databases use SQL and store data in tables with rows and columns.
- Non-Relational databases store data using other data structures.

TABLES AND KEYS
 
Structured Query Language(SQL)
- SQL is a language used for interacting with RDBMS.
- You can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for you
--Create, retrieve, update and delete data.
--Create and manage databases.
--Design and create database tables.
--Perform administration tasks(security, user management, import/export, etc)

-SQL implementations vary between systems
--Not all RDBMS' follow the SQL standard to a 'T'
-- The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary.

SQL is a hybrid language, its basically 4 types of languages in one

- Data Query Language
--Used to query the database for information.
--Get information that is already stored here.

- Data Definition Language
--Used for defining database schemas.

- Data Control Language
--Used for controlling access to the data in the database.

- Data Manipulation Language
--Used for inserting, updating and deleting data form the database.

Queries
- A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS(written in SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.
-TONS of data in a DB.
-Often hidden in a complex schema.
-Goal is to only get the data you need.
